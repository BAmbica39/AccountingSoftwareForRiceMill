Rice Mill Accounting & Inventory Management System
This project is a customized MS Access-based accounting and inventory software designed for a rice mill enterprise. The system automates key operations including truck receipt processing, delivery challans, and accounting for commodity sales such as thavudu (by-product).

âœ… Key Features
1) Truck Receipt Management
Captures comprehensive details from government-issued truck sheets including center info, seller data, rice mill details, and farmer-level inventory records.
2) Weighbridge & Gate Entry Integration
Incorporates weight machine details, extra/shortage bags, and gate entry validation into each truck receipt.
3) Delivery Challan Module
Generates delivery challans for rice dispatch to government agencies, tracking bags, quantity (qtls/kg), value, vehicle details, and dispatch locations.
4) Thavudu Invoicing System
Enables GST-compliant invoice creation with support for discounts, taxes (CGST, SGST, IGST), and waybill tracking.
5) Accounting Module
Includes full ledger-based double-entry bookkeeping with master and transaction tables for:
      Customers
      Suppliers
      Employees
      General Ledger entries
6) Form-Based Transaction Processing
Provides user-friendly forms for vouchers (Payment, Receipt, Journal), auto-linked to ledgers via append queries, and validated using hardcoded logic.
7) Data Locking and Validation
Enforces field-level locking after record posting, prevents zero-value transactions, and ensures required data entry.

ðŸ’¡Technologies Used
Microsoft Access (Forms, Queries, Reports, VBA Logic)
Relational Tables with Primary Keys and Foreign Key Validations
UI design with form navigation, validation prompts, and locking mechanisms

ðŸ“Œ Use Case
Ideal for small to mid-sized rice mills needing a localized, cost-effective ERP solution for managing procurement, inventory movement, billing, and financial transactions.
